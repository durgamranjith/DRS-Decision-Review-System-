# 3rd Umpire Decision Review System (DRS) with Python

The 3rd Umpire Decision Review System (DRS) is a Python project that simulates the cricket Decision Review System used in international cricket matches. This project uses various Python libraries such as tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI), cv2 for computer vision, time for timing, imutils for image processing, and threading for parallel processing.

The DRS allows users to review and challenge on-field decisions made by the umpires during a cricket match. Users can load video clips of the match, analyze the footage, and make their own decisions based on the video evidence.

## Usage

* Load cricket match video clips for analysis.
* Control the playback speed of the video.
* Capture specific frames for closer inspection.
* Review and challenge on-field decisions.

## Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **tkinter, cv2, imutils, threading Libraries**

## Acknowledgements

* Thanks to the developers of the tkinter, OpenCV, imutils, and other libraries used in this project.
* Inspired by the real-world Decision Review System used in international cricket.
